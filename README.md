# Dockerized Jenkins & Sonar combo

This is the Dockerized solution I' am working on, first as a way of learning to navigate Docker and second, as a way to learn how to setup the whole enchilada of Continuous Integration.

## Jenkins

### JDK

TODO: Steps to setup Jenkins

### Pre installed plugins
 - SonarQube

## SonarQube

### Install a code analyzer

Go to `Administration > System > Update Center`, select `Available` and search for *SonarJava*, or whatever lame language you program.

### Generate a Key

Click over your name and then on *My account*, go to *Security*, enter a token name and click on generate. Save the token, you won't be able to see the token again later.
